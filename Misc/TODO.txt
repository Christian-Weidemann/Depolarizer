Build Main scene with Network, UI, Sounds and a GraphSettings resource.

------------     TODO      --------------


Create GraphNode.tscn with visual and collision; implement basic spawn and delete from Main.

Implement GraphNode signals and basic dragging using _physics_process and mode switching.

Implement Edge as a scene that listens to node moved signals and updates Line2D.

Wire selection and connecting mode in Main: click node to select, click another to create edge.

Add deletion logic: deleting node frees connected edges (edges detect missing endpoints).

Polish visuals (GraphNodeVisual reads GraphSettings; Main passes the resource at spawn).

Add saving/loading, performance optimizations (object pools, edge batching) if needed.
