# Depolarizer
A work-in-progress 2D game about reducing network polarization.
Inspired by [Quantifying ideological polarization on a network using generalized Euclidean distance](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abq2044) and my project [Quantifying multipolar polarization](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.16352).
